# Chesscom-WDL-Fixer
## Introduction
Chesscom-WDL-Fixer is a script written in Python that utilizes the chess.com API Python wrapper and user-inputted probabilities to determine how many Chess.com games it would take a user to climb out of a negative W/D/L ratio. The script uses random integers to simulate a win, loss, or draw, and continuously increments until a positive W/D/L ratio has been achieved. A window displaying a plot graph will open up to show the projected growth in W/D/L and the number of trials it would take.

## Usage guidelines
Currently, this script must be downloaded and run through an IDE or command prompt/terminal. Once downloaded, change the `modify_me.json` folder with probabilities from your Chess.com profile for the specified game type that you wish to simulate the number of trials needed to get a positive W/D/L. That information can be pulled from your Chess.com stats for the game type you wish to emulate (i.e. rapid, bullet, blitz) as the Chess.com API I am using does not currently support probabilistic information. Feel free to use any time span of probability, but results may vary. 
## Disclaimers
* The accuracy of this script is not guaranteed and has not been measured. It provides a statistical projection rather than definitive results. For greater accuracy, run the script multiple times and record the average number of trials. 
* The probability inputted is static and may not accurately reflect a user's chess performance over time. That being said, changes in a user's win rate on Chess.com may increase or decrease the number of games needed (trials). Since 7-day performance can fluctuate easily, it is recommended that the probabilities used should be at least 30 days. 
* A win rate below the loss rate may not yield any stable results. For example, a 47-53 win-loss rate or a 47-48 win-loss rate. A win rate below the loss rate will process for a long time and may yield an incredibly large number since the user is more likely to lose games than win them. The relationship between win rate and trials is evaluated to be of the equation $y=Ce^{-rx}$ where $C$ is an undefined coefficient and $r$ is the rate.
