# Chesscom-WDL-Fixer
## Introduction
Chesscom-WDL-Fixer is a script written in Python that utilizes the chess.com API Python wrapper and user-inputted probabilities to determine how many Chess.com games it would take a user to climb out of a negative W/D/L ratio. The script uses random integers to emulate a win, loss, or a draw, and continuously increments until a positive W/D/L ratio has been achieved. A window displaying a plot graph will open up to display the projected growth in W/D/L as well as the amount of trials it would take.

## Usage guidelines
Currently, this script must be downloaded and ran through an IDE or command prompt/terminal. Once downloaded, make sure to change the `modify_me.json` folder with probabilities from your Chess.com profile for the specified game type that you wish to emulate the amount of trials needed to get a positive W/D/L. That information can be pulled from your Chess.com stats for the game type you wish to emulate (i.e. rapid, bullet, blitz) as the chess.com API I am using does not currently support probabilistic information. Feel free to use any time span of probability, but results may vary. 
## Disclaimers
The accuracy of this script is not guaranteed and has not been measured. It provides a statistical projection rather than definitive results. For greater accuracy, run the script multiple times and record the average number of trials. Additionally, the probability inputted is static and may not accurately reflect a user's improvement over time.
